Hello,

I have a question concerning the internal storing of the target-point of a 
group / unit. In which attribute is this saved odr how is the easiest way to 
get this information. (I have found e better / faster algo concerning the 
centering of the camera when selecting a group. Therefore I need this info)

Thanks for answer,
Christian
