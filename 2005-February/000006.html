<PRE>Hello everybody,

My name's Adam Oellermann, and I'm involved in a church youth group. We 
have access to a bunch of older machines (older, but not ancient - 
Pentium IIIs, no 3D graphics acceleration etc), and one of our 
(nontechie) youth group leaders suggest we arrange a multiplayer gaming 
session, naming Doom3 as something the kids would be into. I told him 
I'd look into it, confident that our machines would melt if I even put a 
Doom3 disk in the drive. Also, we have no budget to buy Doom3 (or 
anything else!) anyway. I have the machines set up with Debian, and 
started researching possible games we might play. I hit upon netPanzer, 
liked what I saw, installed it and liked it more. Our young people took 
their first shot at it and they were seriously impressed - netPanzer is 
much better than Xbox or PS/2 games, it would appear! We had the sound 
turned up loud on a bunch of machines, and it was mayhem - tracks 
clanking, missiles flying and tanks exploding in every direction.

We had no trouble at all setting up the clients and the server, and the 
whole setup ran sweetly all evening. I just wanted to thank you guys on 
behalf of our group for the very impressive work you've done. netPanzer 
is easy to get into, highly playable, packed with action - just a blast. 
I am a software developer, but I've never worked on games - however, I'm 
keen to take a look at the netPanzer source, and I'd love to be able to 
put something back sometime!

Thanks again for all the time you've put in!

Adam
