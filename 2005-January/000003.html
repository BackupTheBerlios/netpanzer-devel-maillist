&gt;<i> Developers:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> We are enjoying netPanzer during lunchtime at work, and are actually
</I>&gt;<i> instrumenting the game to collect vehicle tracks and other information
</I>&gt;<i> to feed into various analyses we are conducting. We are also coming up
</I>&gt;<i> with a list of customizations, enhancements, and fixes that we intend
</I>&gt;<i> to pursue. Any bug fixes and generally useful enhancements we implement
</I>&gt;<i> we will gladly provide back to the netPanzer development team for your
</I>&gt;<i> consideration.
</I>Hi, nice to hear.

&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> We have been able to build netPanzer and the supporting libraries
</I>&gt;<i> without any trouble from the distribution tar files within our 64-bit
</I>&gt;<i> SuSE Linux 9.1. We have also built netPanzer successfully from CVS.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> My main question is: we also have Win2K boxes that we run netPanzer on;
</I>&gt;<i> what is the procedure you use to build netPanzer on Win2K? Do you use
</I>&gt;<i> Cygwin and simply compile the support libraries and netPanzer as is? or
</I>&gt;<i> do you somehow use Visual C++?
</I>The last windows releases have been cross compiled from linux
(<A HREF="http://www.libsdl.org/extras/win32/cross/README.txt">http://www.libsdl.org/extras/win32/cross/README.txt</A>). However it should
be also possible to build the thing in mingw32/msys and eventually in
cygwin too (though I never did this).
I also didn't test the code on visual c++ and don't expect it to compile
cleanly there without some changes.

&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> My secondary question is: is there any method to enforce client
</I>&gt;<i> netPanzers to use the same unit profiles as the server? We have one who
</I>&gt;<i> modified his Titan profile, for example, to reduce the generation time
</I>&gt;<i> to 3 seconds. It worked, and in fact, if someone took over a base that
</I>&gt;<i> was producing those &quot;super&quot; Titans, they would benefit from the reduced
</I>&gt;<i> generation time as well (unless they switched production units, when
</I>&gt;<i> they go back to producing Titans they generate at the normal rate).
</I>&gt;<i> Other than going over to his desk and hitting him in the back of the
</I>&gt;<i> head with a large C++ reference book, is there any way for netPanzer to
</I>&gt;<i> keep him (or anyone else) from trying to pull off a similar cheat?
</I>Hmm I didn't analyze the whole game for cheating possibilities yet... So
for some things your c++ book is the best protection at the moment ;-)
However in case you want to work on the code you could take a look at
this, it shouldn't be too hard, since the server is responsible for
building the units, the client should only &quot;display&quot; the game which runs
on the server, but it's very well possible that there are some bugs
where the clients can still change the game rules a bit by sending
strange packets or changing these profiles...

Greetings,
	Matze
