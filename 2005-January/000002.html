<PRE>Developers:

We are enjoying netPanzer during lunchtime at work, and are actually
instrumenting the game to collect vehicle tracks and other information
to feed into various analyses we are conducting. We are also coming up
with a list of customizations, enhancements, and fixes that we intend
to pursue. Any bug fixes and generally useful enhancements we implement
we will gladly provide back to the netPanzer development team for your
consideration.

We have been able to build netPanzer and the supporting libraries
without any trouble from the distribution tar files within our 64-bit
SuSE Linux 9.1. We have also built netPanzer successfully from CVS.

My main question is: we also have Win2K boxes that we run netPanzer on;
what is the procedure you use to build netPanzer on Win2K? Do you use
Cygwin and simply compile the support libraries and netPanzer as is? or
do you somehow use Visual C++?

My secondary question is: is there any method to enforce client
netPanzers to use the same unit profiles as the server? We have one who
modified his Titan profile, for example, to reduce the generation time
to 3 seconds. It worked, and in fact, if someone took over a base that
was producing those &quot;super&quot; Titans, they would benefit from the reduced
generation time as well (unless they switched production units, when
they go back to producing Titans they generate at the normal rate).
Other than going over to his desk and hitting him in the back of the
head with a large C++ reference book, is there any way for netPanzer to
keep him (or anyone else) from trying to pull off a similar cheat?

Thanks,
Tony C.
