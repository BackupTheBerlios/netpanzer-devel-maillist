hi there,,

i have installed netpanzer on my netserver as a dedicated server & would like 
to find more info on anti-cheats, & any other server setup info not included 
in the readme's.

any help here would be much appreciated.

The 0.2 rc versions come with the serverhowto.html file which should
tell you everything you need to know about setting up servers on
linux/bsd.
There are no explicit anti-cheat options yet. Though the game should be
relatively cheat-free as all game rules are executed by the server, the
clients only send commands. However it is relatively easy to crash the
server if you send malformed packets.

Subject: [Netpanzer-devel] Procedure for building on Windows
Message-ID: <20050114223042.77295.qmail@web41202.mail.yahoo.com>

Developers:

We are enjoying netPanzer during lunchtime at work, and are actually
instrumenting the game to collect vehicle tracks and other information
to feed into various analyses we are conducting. We are also coming up
with a list of customizations, enhancements, and fixes that we intend
to pursue. Any bug fixes and generally useful enhancements we implement
we will gladly provide back to the netPanzer development team for your
consideration.

We have been able to build netPanzer and the supporting libraries
without any trouble from the distribution tar files within our 64-bit
SuSE Linux 9.1. We have also built netPanzer successfully from CVS.

My main question is: we also have Win2K boxes that we run netPanzer on;
what is the procedure you use to build netPanzer on Win2K? Do you use
Cygwin and simply compile the support libraries and netPanzer as is? or
do you somehow use Visual C++?

My secondary question is: is there any method to enforce client
netPanzers to use the same unit profiles as the server? We have one who
modified his Titan profile, for example, to reduce the generation time
to 3 seconds. It worked, and in fact, if someone took over a base that
was producing those "super" Titans, they would benefit from the reduced
generation time as well (unless they switched production units, when
they go back to producing Titans they generate at the normal rate).
Other than going over to his desk and hitting him in the back of the
head with a large C++ reference book, is there any way for netPanzer to
keep him (or anyone else) from trying to pull off a similar cheat?

Thanks,
Tony C.

Hi, nice to hear.

The last windows releases have been cross compiled from linux
(http://www.libsdl.org/extras/win32/cross/README.txt). However it should
be also possible to build the thing in mingw32/msys and eventually in
cygwin too (though I never did this).
I also didn't test the code on visual c++ and don't expect it to compile
cleanly there without some changes.

Hmm I didn't analyze the whole game for cheating possibilities yet... So
for some things your c++ book is the best protection at the moment ;-)
However in case you want to work on the code you could take a look at
this, it shouldn't be too hard, since the server is responsible for
building the units, the client should only "display" the game which runs
on the server, but it's very well possible that there are some bugs
where the clients can still change the game rules a bit by sending
strange packets or changing these profiles...

Greetings,
	Matze
