Subject: [Netpanzer-devel] endless loop detected...
Message-ID: <433066CF.3080001@php-projekte.de>

hi,

is there something I can do to fix that annoying "endless loop detected" 
problem?

I thought it (the "0x0000 problem") would be fixed in the latest code 
from the svn trunk.
but the error keeps on raising randomly and crashing the netpanzer server.

or are there other common reasons which cause the crash. if yes, what 
can I do there?

I am running the latest svn version of netpanzer on an amd 1000Ghz, 
128mb, Debian unstable, dsl 4mbit down/0,5mbit up...

t(h)anks,

Markus

Subject: [Netpanzer-devel] patch to use the numeric keypad to create group.
Message-ID: <43358964.8000102@9online.fr>

Hi,

On my linux box (mandriva 2005LE), I never succeed to create a group of 
tank.

The reason is that, on my french keyboard, no key seems to have the key 
code SDLK_0 (-9).
(Yes, french keyboard are strange...).

So I have made a patch to allow the use of the numeric keypad (code 
SDLK_KP0 (-9)).

It work great for me, and probably for every body who have a numeric keypad.

Can the patch be integrated  in the next version ?
